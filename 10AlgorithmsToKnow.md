Just know these and find your ways around solutions rather than learning or rather memorizing 200s of different solutions 

## Depth first search
 - recursion, back tracking ( improve with dynamic programing or caching subproblem solutions )
 - inorder, preorder, post order traversal
 - When? - string, substring 

## Breadth first search
 - Queue
 - level order traversal
 - When? -
