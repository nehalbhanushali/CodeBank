1. <b>If</b> you have the <b>index</b>

Fastest: Array(no hashCoding, etc) > HashMap > HashTable (slower due to synchronising)
E.g : see difference between array and hashMap [in this trie implementation](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/submissions/) referred 
from [this solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/discuss/58832/AC-JAVA-solution-simple-using-single-array)
