Just know these and find your ways around solutions rather than learning or rather memorizing 200s of different solutions 

## Depth first search
 - recursion, back tracking (internally a stack solution)
 - inorder, preorder, post order traversal
 - Enhancements: improve with dynamic programing or caching subproblem solutions
 - When? - string, substring

## Breadth first search
 - Uses queues
 - level order traversal
 - When? - 
 
## Valid parenthesis
 - stack solution
 
## Dynamic programming using HashTables or arrays as needed
 - improves the revisiting probles a 2D matrix traversal encounters
 - Works well for caching subproblem solutions in dynamic programming approach
 - When? Fibonacci
 
 ## manipulate multiple pointers/variables at once

 #### I started this document as 10 algorithms to know as the channel suggests, then they turned to data structures to know, and then really tricks to know :D
